# Thank  for inviting me for the test.

I have push the .env with this test, so you can have database name for the students record.

I have include the database to, to show the structure, although somthing is not properly working well at the
time i type this, which I believe it will work soon before it is assessed. 

Check each folders for in the root directory to have access to each Solution as it was given.  Thanks.


Major challenge: 
  1. My major challenge was the state of my health as at the time I was ask to these test, I have been admitted before it came. So I had time 
  contsriant. 
2. Structuring the database for the database code, So I could not dockerise the project.
